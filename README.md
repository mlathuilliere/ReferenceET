Calculation of reference ET (ET0) as per FAO guidelines Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56  (FAO56)
http://www.fao.org/docrep/X0490E/x0490e00.htm#Contents
All equations are numbered according to the FAO56 equation numbering

Important notes:

1) ET0 (mm/30min or mm/day) refers to evapotranspiration of a reference surface which here is 0.12 m
   grass, well watered, with an albedo of 0.23. Based on the position of your net radiometer, you
   might need to make an albedo correction in the code. E.g. if your net radiometer is installed
   above a crop canopy then net radiation of grass Rn(grass) is
   Rn(grass) = Rs(alpha(crop) + alpha(grass)) + Rn(crop)
   where Rs is the incoming shortwave radiation measured by a pyranometer, alpha are the albedos of
   the crop (needed) and the grass reference (= 0.23 accoding to FAO56)

2) The values of ET0 are calculated with error bars (e.ET0) obtained by propagating sensor
   measurement error obtained from the sensor specifications

   Sensors used:
    - Net radiation (Rn): Kipp & Zonene NRLite 2 (assume 5% error in measurement)
    - Meteorological data: Vaisala WXT520 meteorological stattion
      -Wind speed (Ws)        +/- 0.3 m/s
      -air temperature (Tair) +/- 0.3 oC
      -relative humidity (RH) +/- 4   %
    - Ground heat flux (G): Huksefflux and thermal plates (assume 10% error in measurement)
    - Solar radiation (Rs): LI-COR 200X with +/- 3% typicall accuracy
